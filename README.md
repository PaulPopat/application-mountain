# Application Mountain

This tool is a way to manage your steam library.
You can tag apps and then filter by multiple tags and do text search.

Happy sorting!

Possible in the future:

- Friends and chat (this is not a priority as Discord exists)

# Installation

_Please make sure that your library is public, for this application to work!_

It should all work by itself. You need to have Steam installed, the app will look for the Steam executable
in program files (x86). If you do not have Steam installed there, you will be prompted to point it to
the executable. From there, it will check for your library folders and work out what is installed, etc.
You will be required to log into Steam for this to work. All that will be stored from this is your user ID
number. This ID will be used to call the public APIs to get your library and such. It will not be able
to access anything that is not publicly available.

The application will automatically update itself.
