This tool is a way to manage your steam library.
You can tag apps and then filter by multiple tags and do text search.

Happy sorting!

To do:

- Improve refresh after buying games
- Add support for multiple accounts on one machine

Possible in the future:

- Friends and chat (this is not a priority as Discord exists)
